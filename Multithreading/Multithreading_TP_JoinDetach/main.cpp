/*
There are following two routines which we can use to join or detach threads âˆ’

pthread_join (threadid, status) 
pthread_detach (threadid) 

The pthread_join() subroutine blocks the calling thread until the specified 'threadid' thread terminates. 
When a thread is created, one of its attributes defines whether it is joinable or detached. 
Only threads that are created as joinable can be joined. 
If a thread is created as detached, it can never be joined.
